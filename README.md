## Overview

Are video games improving, or did the golden age already pass?

Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than **$300 billion by 2027** (Mordor Intelligence). With so much at stake, publishers are constantly striving to produce the next blockbuster hit.

In this project, we analyze the **top 400 best-selling video games** released between **1977 and 2020**. We compare sales data with **critic and user review scores** to assess whether games have improved as the industry has matured.
